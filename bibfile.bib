  abstract = {A classical thermodynamic model for spark-ignited internal combustion engine simulation in which the heat addition process that takes a finite amount of time to complete is presented along with an illustrative parameter sensibility case study. The model accounts for all air-standard Otto cycle parameters, as well as crank-connecting rod mechanism, ignition timing, engine operating speed, and cumulative heat release history parameters. The model is particularly suitable for engineering undergraduate education, as it preserves most of the air-standard assumptions, while being able to reproduce real engine traits, such as the decay of maximum pressure, power, and thermal efficiency at higher engine operating speeds. In terms of complexity, the resulting finite-time heat addition Otto cycle sits between the classical air-standard Otto cycle and the more involved air–fuel Otto cycle, that are usually introduced on more advanced mechanical engineering courses, and allows students to perform engine parameter sensibility studies using only classical, single phase, pure substance, undergraduate engineering thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {The polytropic process equation, $Pv^n = C$, is widely taught in mechanical engineering curricula throughout the world as an important concept in thermodynamics. Unfortunately, it is too often presented as a statement of fact, providing the student with little or no understanding of its fundamental basis. Herein the principal underpinnings of this foundational equation are elucidated by the introduction of a new term, called the energy transfer ratio (K). A teaching approach centered around the energy transfer ratio can give the student new insights into polytropic processes. Reversible polytropic processes in closed and open systems are examined, including open systems where the Mach number is signifi cant. The discussion is then expanded to include irreversible processes. It is hoped that the reader will fi nd this material to be a useful reference in presenting polytropic processes to students.},
